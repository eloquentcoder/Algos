Given an array of integers nums sorted in non-decreasing order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.

If target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

DIFFICULTY LEVEL: Medium

HINT: Since the question insists we use O(log n), we should do a binary search.
