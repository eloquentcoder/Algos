There are certain terminologies you need to learn when dealing with binary trees. A binary tree is a tree in which every node has at most two children.

A Node is a point in a binary tree that has data. 

A node with not parent is called a root. In a binary tree there can only be one root node.

A Node with no children is called a leaf node.

A  tree is a binary tree if it has one root, only at most two children per node and one path only from parent to children.
