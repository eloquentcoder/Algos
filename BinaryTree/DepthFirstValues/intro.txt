Given the root of a binary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.

Example 1:

Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
Output: [1,2,3]
Example 2:

Input: root = []
Output: []
Example 3:

Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]
 

HINT: The stack datastructure is the best way to traverse a tree in a preorder manner(process the root then the subtrees). Using a recursion also makes use of the function call stack so you can also do it recursively.
