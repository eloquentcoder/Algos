Given the root of a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.


DIFFICULTY: Easy

Example 1:


Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
Output: [1,3,2]
Example 2:

Input: root = []
Output: []
Example 3:

Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]

HINT: Process all nodes of a tree by processing the left subtree, then processing the root, and finally the right subtree. Also known as symmetric traversal.
