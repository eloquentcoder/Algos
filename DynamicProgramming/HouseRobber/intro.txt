You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police


Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.


HINT: using a bottoms up approach, you can loop through each house store the maximum amount needed to rob at each house. You can compute that by comparing at every turn the max amount you can steal at the previous at the previous house and the amount you can steal at the current house plus the max amount at the house before the previous
