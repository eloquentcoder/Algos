Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9

HINT: This can be best solved using a bottoms up dynamic programming approach where we can compute the lowest value then solve the subsequent value

TIME_COMPLEXITY: 0(a * c) where a is the amount and c is the number of coins
SPACE_COMPLEXITY:  0(a) where a is the amount
