A linkedlist is a linear data structure that consists of nodes and links to other nodes in a linear format.
Example of a linkedlist


A -> B -> C -> D

A node is an object that contains data of any kind be it string, numbers characters or even other objects.

SOME TERMINOLOGIES
1. The head of a linkedlist is the first node in a linked list.
2. The tail of a linkedlist is the last node in a linked list.
3. The node after a node is called the next node.
4. There are two types of linkedlist, a singly linkedlist which is a one way linkedlist in which a node can only point to its next
and a doubly linkedlist with pointers to a next node and a previous node.
