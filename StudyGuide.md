This is my own opinion on how i feel any beginner should get started. So i feel the following questions should be given preference to when starting out. After that you can pretty much pick randomly and study. Also try to alternate between different algorithm category intermittently to get the best out of this repo. 


1. HashMaps/TwoSum
2. SlidingWindow/TwoSumII
3. SlidingWindow/ThreeSum
4. Arrays/PascalTriangle
5. Numbers/PalindromeNumber
6. String/ValidPalindrome
7. DynamicProgramming/FibonacciNumber
