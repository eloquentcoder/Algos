Knowing Algorithms and datastructures is the main requirement for so many software engineering roles in the world of tech today. It is important to be able to write algorithms in any language of your chosing but it won't hurt to see familiar languages you can follow. Yeah i know there are so many resources on these all over the web but PHP developers might feel a little bit left out and dart developers might have little to no solution for them. Well here is a repo targeting the lesser known languages as well as javascript. Contributions are highly welcome.

This algorithm repo is structured based on different algorithm category. Under a category you have different algorithm questions inside a folder. Inside each question folder you have an intro.txt file and mostly three solutions to the question. Inside the intro.txt you have the question with examples in case you want to try it yourself. I even leave a hint on how to approach the question as well as links to videos and articles to help you learn in case you get stuck. Inside each solution you get a line by line instruction and guide into what each line of code means and what is does. I have tried to make it as detailed and easy to understand as possible.

For those starting out with datastructures and algorithms and don't know where to start from you can basically start with any question but if you need a study guide you can check the StudyGuide.md file for my own opinion and tips of how to structure your learning to get the best out of this repo.
