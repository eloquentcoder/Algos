Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

DIFFICULTY LEVEL: Medium

Example 1:

Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9

HINT: The goal is to solve without sorting the array. A visual representation might help. A sequence can be determined by checking if the current number is the start of a sequence and using a set datastructure to check if the next number exists and updating the length accordingly

TIME_COMPLEXITY: 0(n) where n is the number of inputs of th function
SPACE_COMPLEXITY:  0(n) where n is the number of inputs of th function
