HINT: Use two pointers to move move through the string and use an appropriate data structure to get duplicate. Most sliding window patterns work well with sets

TIME_COMPLEXITY: 0(n) where n is the number of characters in the string
SPACE_COMPLEXITY:  0(n) where n is the number of characters in the string
