Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

DIFFICULTY LEVEL: Easy

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]

HINT: Use a hashmap as it allows for 0(1) lookup when checking if the difference is in hashmap

TIME_COMPLEXITY: 0(n) where n is the number of elememts in the nums array
SPACE_COMPLEXITY:  0(1)
